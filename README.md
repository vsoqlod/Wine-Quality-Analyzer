# Wine-Quality-Analyzer

## Overview
The Wine Definition Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to analyze and classify wine characteristics with high precision. Developed using Jupyter Notebook, this project leverages the power of machine learning, data analysis, and visualization to provide a comprehensive understanding of wine qualities.

## Features
* Random Forest Classifier: Employs the Random Forest algorithm from the sklearn library to accurately classify wines based on their characteristics, achieving an impressive accuracy of approximately 93%.
* Data Analysis: Utilizes pandas and numpy for efficient data manipulation and analysis, enabling the handling of complex wine datasets.
* Visualization: Incorporates matplotlib and seaborn for creating intuitive graphs and heatmaps, making it easier to understand the data patterns and model performance.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries: sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
